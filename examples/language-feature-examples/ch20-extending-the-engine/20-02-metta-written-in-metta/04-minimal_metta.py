"""Purpose: examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-02-metta-written-in-metta/04-minimal_metta.metta in Python: the instruction set, run.

Twenty-eight claims about minimal MeTTa's own instructions: `function` and
`return`, the `unify-mod` matcher, the recursive `mm-switch`, the reduction
loop, `collapse-bind` and `superpose-bind`, the Turing machine, and the partial
function. All of them are the file's subject, so all of them are named.

Each instruction is CALLED, `m.fn.function(...)` and `m.fn.unify_mod(...)`,
and most of them carry a MeTTa variable in an argument, because that is what
an instruction set is made of: `(chain (+ 1 2) $x (return $x))` binds `$x`,
`(unify-mod (p 5) (p $x) (got $x) else)` matches it, `(mm-reduce (step-down 3)
$x $x)` templates it. A call answers what the instruction reduced to whether
or not its arguments carry variables, so the call door says all of them.

Three claims keep a composed term instead, and each names its reason on the
line. `collapse` is one: at the call door `mm-switch` with no matching case
answers the `Empty` atom, where `(collapse ...)` is what PRUNES it, so
`list()` would collect an answer the engine does not give. `return` is the
other: it is an instruction inside `function` rather than a function of its
own, so the namespace has nothing to resolve. The partial-function refusal is
also collapsed because `Empty` means no answer, making the empty answer set the
claim rather than the literal marker.

Every name here descends the ladder exactly as far as it has to. Hyphenated
heads take the attribute door, `S.mm_switch` and `S.collapse_bind`, because
rung 4's map is total. The bracket is kept only for what Python's grammar
cannot say: the keywords `return` and `else`, the punctuation heads `:=`,
`...` and `<-`, and `minimal_metta_lib`, whose MeTTa name really does have
underscores.
