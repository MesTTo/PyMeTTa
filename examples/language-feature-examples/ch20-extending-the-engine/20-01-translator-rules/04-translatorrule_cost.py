"""examples/ch20-extending-the-engine/20-01-translator-rules/04-translatorrule_cost.metta in Python: cost, and a joined head.

A bidirectional rule says two forms are equivalent, and a COST is what decides
which one the compiler emits: a rewrite fires only when it lowers the total,
and a form's cost is its node count unless a rule declares one for its head.
Declared at 10, `pow2` is expensive enough that squaring a small argument
expands and squaring a big one collapses, and the file's first three claims are
that turn.

The second half is a CONJUNCTIVE left side. `unit-of` has no equation at all;
the rule itself names the call it rewrites and a second pattern matched against
the space, so `$q` joins the two and `$u` carries the answer out. That is why
its type declaration is data rather than an annotation: there is no def to
annotate.

`pow2` is an ordinary compiled function whose parameter is annotated `Atom`, so
the argument arrives unreduced, which is what the original's own type
declaration says. Its body names `mul`, and that name takes the bracket: the
operator word table owns `S.mul` and makes it `*`, where this `mul` is a plain
data head with no equations behind it and multiplying two expressions is not
what the rule means.
