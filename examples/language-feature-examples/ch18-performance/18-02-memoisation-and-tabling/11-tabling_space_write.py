"""Purpose: examples/ch18-performance/18-02-memoisation-and-tabling/11-tabling_space_write.metta in Python: a table over a space stays fresh.

The engine declares the storage predicates a tabled function reads incremental,
so SWI invalidates and re-evaluates the table on the next call by itself. Six
claims watch that happen across an add, a remove, and a conjunction that reads
two patterns.

`reach` and `bypattern` are ordinary compiled definitions. Inside a body the
expression-position `match(space, pattern, template)` is read as syntax and
emits the instruction, so `match(m, S.edge(x, y), y)` stores exactly the
example's `(match &self (edge $x $y) $y)`, and `match(m, p, p)` passes its
pattern straight through as a PARAMETER. SWI tabling stays an explicit
`lib.tabling` declaration because `lib_memo`'s `memoize-exact` has the distinct
exact-bag memo law.

`twohop` stays at the container door, which is the residue entry this file
carries. A conjunction pattern `(, p q)` has no compiled spelling: the receiver
door takes a conjunction as varargs, `space.match(p, q)`, while the compiled
`match()` takes only a pattern and a template, with the space optional.

Both readers are projected the same way. `reach` and `bypattern` have Python
names and their claims read `reach(S.a, V.y).y == [S.b]`, the projection the
answers family rules; `twohop` has none, so it is called through the space's
own function namespace and `.z` is that same projection. A call keeps its
caller-variable columns inside a `space.stats()` scope, which is the scope
every twin runs in, so the two doors agree.

The refusal at the end comes back through `eval`, because its `$p` is an
argument the answer does not depend on.

The last claim is compared with `alpha_eq` rather than against printed text. The
engine names the unresolved variable freshly, so the example's `$_0` is `$_558`
here and would be a third name tomorrow; alpha equality is the relation the law
already defines for exactly this, and it belongs to the atom. The refusal's
own head keeps the bracket: `metta_tabling_unresolved_read` really has
underscores, and the attribute door maps every underscore to a hyphen.
