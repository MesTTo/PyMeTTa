"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-03-let-and-sequencing/02-letlet.metta in Python: a destructuring binding.

The `let*` binding here is a PATTERN, `(($f1 $c1 3) (1 2 $d1))`: three
variables and a literal on the left meeting three values on the right, so `$f1`
and `$c1` bind leftwards while `$d1` binds rightwards from the literal 3. The
answer is `(1 2 3)`.

Python spells the left-to-right half `f1, c1, _ = 1, 2, d1`, and a compiled
body refuses even that: "a compiled body binds plain names; destructuring and
attribute assignment have no let* form" [re-measured 2026-08-24;
commit=028b41a056cfd706e516cd0b945cbf69ac066da7]. Nor does `solve`, the `let` door for a pattern that must win
variables, reach into a body: it is a module function and the subset reads only
its own names there. So the equation is stated as the term it is and filed
against P14.4.
Guarantees:
  - every ordered atom assembled in this file passes one iterable to
    Expression [tested: test_expression_assembles_one_ordered_atom_from_an_iterable; commit=028b41a056cfd706e516cd0b945cbf69ac066da7]
