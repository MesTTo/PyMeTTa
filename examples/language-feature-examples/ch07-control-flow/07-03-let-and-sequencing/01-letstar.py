"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-03-let-and-sequencing/01-letstar.metta in Python: sequential bindings.

Inside a compiled body `x = 1` IS a `let*` binding: the decorator folds a
statement list into nested bindings around what follows it, so the Python for
this file is three lines of ordinary function body and the equation stored is
`(let* (($x 1)) (let* (($y 2)) (+ $x $y)))`, the same nesting the source
writes flat.

#: PLACEHOLDER, never measured in this worktree: the integrator's single
#: re-pin pass prices the whole corpus under the lane's own protocol after the
#: wave merges [assumed: BUDGET states no measured cost; commit=028b41a056cfd706e516cd0b945cbf69ac066da7].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 3153 to 3172, at the flat-door
#: typed-dispatch gate and the library import door landing
#: together: every flat call prices one declaration read through
#: type_declaration_in/3, a declared head's flat call routes
#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own
#: form runs (metta_py_typed_dispatch_applies/2, the P14.9
#: residue retirement), and an import-bearing twin now spells
#: its import as `m += lib.x` on the write door [measured
#: 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3
#: on the tree carrying both].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 3172 to 3183, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any
#: boot-content change moves twin counts a few tens through SWI's
#: clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header carries the A/B),
#: so the corpus re-pins once on the exact shipping tree
#: [measured 2026-08-25 through tools/twin_coverage.py --measure
#: min-of-3 on the final tree].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 3183 to 3117, on the release tree:
#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
#: call), the conformance kit gained the family, source and
#: round-trip laws, extensions gained the spaces([...]) readying
#: moment, and any boot-content change also moves counts a few
#: tens through SWI's clause-indexing shape (qlf_boot.pl's header
#: carries the A/B), so the corpus re-pins once on the exact
#: shipping tree [measured 2026-08-25 through
#: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 after a canonical
#: single-boot QLF regeneration].
#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 3117 to 3127, at the release cut: the
#: identity-wire merge (numeric ownership seams, exact-primitive
#: wire, Python operator dispatch), the rules-body staging split
#: (ground folds, op-call staging), and the door-combinations
#: example growing the corpus each move counts through SWI's
