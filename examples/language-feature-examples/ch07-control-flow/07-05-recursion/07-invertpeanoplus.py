"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-05-recursion/07-invertpeanoplus.metta in Python: Peano addition, run every way.

Two equations define `plus` forwards. Unifying the SUM with what the call
produces then runs it backwards: fix the sum and one operand and the other
comes out bound; fix only the sum and every pair that reaches it is
enumerated; ask for the first answer only and one pair comes back.

The definition takes the `@m.rules` shape of the definitional decorator
because both heads are PATTERNS rather than parameters: `(plus Z $y)` fixes a
symbol and `(plus (S $x) $y)` fixes a whole subterm. A stacked `@m.define`
clause fixes a head position with a literal DEFAULT, and a literal is a bool,
int, float or str, so neither head has a function-shape spelling. The residue
table records that against P14.4. The bound decorator writes the bundle and
lands it in this space in one act, and its parameters ARE the equations'
variables.

The numerals are built by a Python function, since `(S (S (S (S Z))))` is just
`S` applied four times, and writing that out in three different forms is what
made the original hard to read.

`m.solve(pattern, subject)` inverts: the sum on `let`'s pattern side, the call
on its subject side, and the answer projected by the variable's own name.
`once` dissolves into `first()`, the rows' own row-or-nothing accessor.
Guarantees:
