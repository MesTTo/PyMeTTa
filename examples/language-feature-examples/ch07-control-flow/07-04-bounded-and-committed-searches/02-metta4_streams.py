"""Purpose: examples/ch07-control-flow/07-04-bounded-and-committed-searches/02-metta4_streams.metta in Python: answers as a stream.

`range` answers one number at a time, and the three things the file does with
those answers are three ordinary Python lines: iterating them all, taking the
first, and folding them into a total.

`range` itself is the superposition it is: `superpose(k, counter(k + 1, n))`
is the fork in expression position and `empty()` is the branch with nothing to
say, so the equation stored is the original's own. Written as a generator with
two yields it would store one superposition wrapped in another, which answers
the same and is not the same knowledge. It is `counter` on the Python side
because `range` is a BUILTIN a compiled body lowers to `py-range` before it
looks for the definition's own name, so `def range` would compile its own
recursion to the builtin and answer `[1, (2 3 4)]`; `name="range"` puts the
MeTTa name on the equation and the recursion resolves to it.

metta4's `forall` runs its body once per answer and stops early if one answers
false, which is what a `for` loop over an iterator already does; `once` is
`first(default=...)`, which pulls at most one answer out of the lazy view and
leaves the producer where it stands; and `foldall` with `+` and a zero start is
`sum`, because a fold over answers is collection work and the dissolution
table puts collection work in Python.

That last fold adds Python numbers, not atoms, so it reads the answers'
carried scalars: `+` over a grounded atom STAGES `(+ ...)` rather than
computing it, which is what makes `G(1) + 2` a term everywhere else in this
corpus [source: extensions/python/metta/_atoms_core.py, Grounded.value;
re-measured 2026-08-24: `sum(m.fn.gen())` builds `(+ (+ (+ 0 1) 2) 3)`;
commit=028b41a056cfd706e516cd0b945cbf69ac066da7].

`gen` has three clauses for one head. Stacked `@m.define` will not say that:
stacking reads as first-match, so two clauses fixing no literal are a
REDEFINITION. `@rules` is the other shape of the definitional door and says it
directly, and `space += bundle` lands the clause set through the one write
door.

The historical stored-equation divergence is lifted. The annotation publishes
its type declaration, `(: range (-> Number Number Number))`, so the
whole-space digest deliberately differs even though the equation agrees.
Guarantees:
  - UNIT used here is a package value rather than a local reconstruction
