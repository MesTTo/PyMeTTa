"""Purpose: examples/ch05-equations-and-evaluation/05-03-the-number-library/02-math_exp_random.metta in Python: exp, log, and the dice.

The engine computes `exp` and `log`; the subtraction, the absolute value and
the comparison that check them are Python's own, so the float-tolerance lines
read as ordinary Python and pay no crossing for the arithmetic around the
call. A nested call is BUILT with the static `fn` namespace and evaluated
once, so `(log-math e (exp-math 3.0))` is one term rather than two crossings,
which is the crossing rule as well as the spelling.

The original's `and` is a Python keyword, so the compiled body takes the exact
static-function escape, `fn["and"]`, while each comparison uses Python's
operator spelling and lowers to the corresponding engine relation.

The historical stored-equation divergence is lifted. The annotation publishes
its type declaration, `(: in-range (-> Number Number Number Bool))`, so the
whole-space digest deliberately differs even though the equation agrees.

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-09, 9357 to 9352 (-5), Public add-atom calls
#: metta_add_atom/4 directly and the native bulk loop calls add_sexp_in/5
#: directly, removing one forwarding inference per accepted atom while keeping
#: the atomic token clock, hooks and errors. Open native enumeration uses the
#: shared native_storage_functor/2 mapping, including parametric scalar
#: storage. Receipt scopes retain the nearest unnested transaction and post no
#: cleanup when no reservation exists. Full-lane ten-round observations on the
#: repaired tree place this point below the published budget; the provisioned
#: cut is 3e5855a35d7b206c847845f12467551ea4c54a59. See the 2026-09-09 entries in

#: tree after FROM's reference rows and four engine units, the closed-set
#: derivations and two host services, BINDING's one native evaluation entry and
#: boot import, W-OBSERVE's observer guard, PERF's receipts batching and cursor
#: retirement, and the three REDS repairs (derived runtime resources and the
#: shared loader, the tool-lane repairs, the corpus example); serial minimum of

#: DIVERGED 2026-09-07, the example holds 0 atoms the twin does not (none) and
#: the twin holds 1 atom the example does not (1 :): a Python annotation IS a (:
#: name (-> ...)) row and a docstring on a compiled function IS an (@doc name
#: ...) row, so the twin's space carries the declarations and the documentation
#: its own file states where the example leaves both unsaid [measured
