"""Purpose: examples/ch05-equations-and-evaluation/05-01-an-equation-is-a-rewrite/08-functionhead3.metta in Python: one constraint per argument.

`in` keeps a value only when it is a member of a list, and `myplus` chains one
constraint per argument, so the relation runs in BOTH directions: give it two
numbers and it filters, give it variables and it enumerates what is reachable.
The last form runs the whole relation backwards through a guard.

Both definitions are decorated Python functions, and both need the descent
ladder's bottom rung, each for its own reason. `in` is a Python KEYWORD, so no
Python function can carry that name: `name="in"` gives the equation the name
the example uses, and the decorated `is_in` object carries that exact MeTTa
head when another compiled body calls it. `is-member` is
an engine function whose spelling is hyphenated, and `fn.is_member` is its
mention door, rung 4's map applied at the factory.

The variables `myplus` chains over are holes rather than parameters, which
`V.x` and `V.y` say inside the body, and `S.let` names the relational `let`
Python's assignment does not reach.

A call answers what the relation reduces to, whether or not its arguments
carry variables, so running `myplus` backwards is the same Python line as
running it forwards; the bindings those variables took are the parallel row
face on the same view. `collapse` dissolves either way, because the view
already IS the list of answers. Only the last claim evaluates a term instead
of calling, because a `let`-as-guard has to wrap the call.

#: a library with a Prolog half pays the artifact load where both sides paid
#: the source consult and its compile-time expansion in every process,
#: lib_thread's import 278,309 to 5,925 inferences; every import now resolves
#: its spec and asks the boot's claim, about 180 inferences an import, and the
#: boot's content moved (the door, the seam and the three library imports the
#: tokens, receipts and seed units gained), which shifts clause layout by tens;

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-09, 8628 to 8638 (+10), engine/qlf_boot.pl gained the
#: hermetic child that writes the engine's own artifact set and every library
#: half's (qlf_child/2, qlf_regenerate_aside/1, qlf_child_boot/0,
#: qlf_shell_words/2), so no process's flags, initialisation file or packs
#: shape an artifact the tree shares; the boot file's added predicates move the
#: first definition's warm-up by ten, the load-structure movement its header
#: records for any boot-content change, and the lane's authoring constant moves
#: with it (warmup 1482); a twin importing a half pays the claim's freshness

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-09, 8638 to 8629 (-9), Public add-atom calls
#: metta_add_atom/4 directly and the native bulk loop calls add_sexp_in/5
#: directly, removing one forwarding inference per accepted atom while keeping
#: the atomic token clock, hooks and errors. Open native enumeration uses the
#: shared native_storage_functor/2 mapping, including parametric scalar
#: storage. Receipt scopes retain the nearest unnested transaction and post no
#: cleanup when no reservation exists. Full-lane ten-round observations on the
#: repaired tree place this point below the published budget; the provisioned
