"""Purpose: examples/ch05-equations-and-evaluation/05-04-arithmetic-that-runs-backwards/01-backward_arithmetic.metta in Python: arithmetic run backwards.

`+ - * /` are RELATIONS: give any two of the three and the engine solves for
the third, so a function written forwards reads backwards for free. Past one
unknown the rearrangement runs out and a CONSTRAINT begins, which is what the
`#` family is for, and past that the engine refuses by name rather than
guessing.

Both definitions are ordinary Python functions, and every backward query is
built with Python's own operators, because an operator over an atom BUILDS
the term (`V.p + 2` is `(+ $p 2)`) and a backward query always has a variable
in it. The inversion itself is `m.solve(pattern, subject)`: the known value
goes on `let`'s pattern side, the call goes on its subject side, and the
answer template is derived from the subject's variables, so the third
hand-written `let` argument disappears and each solution is projected by the
variable's own name.

The `#` family takes both function-namespace doors, one per job: `m.fn["#div"]`
CALLS the constraint, and the static `fn["#>="]` names the symbol itself, which
is what a term the engine must receive unevaluated needs.

One form still writes `let` by hand, and it is the GUARD reading rather than
the inversion: `(let True <constraint> <question>)` posts a bound and then
asks inside the same derivation, because the constraint store is undone on
the way out. `solve` does not reach it, since its answer template comes from
the subject and here the answer is another query.

An expected answer is a Python tuple, which encodes to the expression the
original writes, and a collapse is the list an evaluation already answers, so
the original's `(noeval ...)` wrappers have nothing to guard against here: a
Python list is data and is never evaluated a second time.
Guarantees:
  - TRUE, FALSE, UNIT, and HERE used here are package values rather
    than local reconstructions [tested: test_the_canonical_atoms_are_public_values;

#: beside itself on its first import and loads from the artifact after

#: a library with a Prolog half pays the artifact load where both sides paid
#: the source consult and its compile-time expansion in every process,
#: lib_thread's import 278,309 to 5,925 inferences; every import now resolves
#: its spec and asks the boot's claim, about 180 inferences an import, and the

#: qlf_shell_words/2), so no process's flags, initialisation file or packs

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-10, 37501 to 36024 (-1477), the binding resolves Janus
#: maplist/2 at boot, removing its first-failure autoload; one compiled option
#: policy removes repeated evaluation frames, and keyed dispatch removes
#: repeated transport/context selection. Indexed source-macro hooks preserve
#: unrelated compilation costs. Same-cut controls and all before/after rows are
#: in docs/journal/2026-09-09-the-binding-collapse.md. These three fresh serial

#: transfers its watch to the nearest live transaction, preventing notification
#: of an engine's discarded outer query frame. The changed boot predicate set
#: also changes current_predicate/1's catalog-arity enumeration order. A same-
#: worktree old/current/restore control and native call-site coverage locate
#: each five-inference step in spaces:metta_catalog_clause/2:
#: current_predicate, the arity guard, functor, metta_storage_term and clause.

#: RE-PINNED 2026-09-10, 36019 to 36024 (+5), automatic memo reconciliation
#: uses a trailed marker so an inference-limit signal cannot leak its guard.
#: The ordinary dirty drain saves two inferences; the first unset-marker read
#: in each engine invokes SWI's undefined-global hook. Removing the old thread-
#: local predicate also changes catalog-arity enumeration order: five
#: inferences per visited arity in metta_catalog_clause/2 or the partial-list
#: get_native_atom/3 lookup. Same-worktree old/current/restore measurements,
#: native call-site coverage and actual missing-global events separate those
#: costs. See docs/journal/2026-09-09-the-binding-collapse.md. These are three
