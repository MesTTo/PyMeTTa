"""Purpose: examples/ch08-data/08-03-the-shipped-libraries/09-conformance.metta in Python: proving a Prolog provider.

`metta.testing.check_space_provider` takes a Python OBJECT, so the seam's
faster tier had no way to prove itself: a Prolog provider is a set of multifile
clauses and there is nothing to pass. `check-space-provider` asks the same
three checks of a space, and this file is that function's own example, so the
twin names it. The space it checks is handed over as the HANDLE it is, reached
by ATOM rather than by text, because a space name is a symbol.

The second claim needs nothing MeTTa-side at all: the provider answers through
the seam, so its space has a handle like any other and the query is the
handle's own. `sort-atom` around it is `sorted`.

One name keeps the bracket because its MeTTa spelling really has
underscores: the provider's own `demo_provider`. The attribute door maps
every underscore to a hyphen, so `S.demo_provider` would be the symbol
`demo-provider`, which nothing declares.

#: A PLACEHOLDER, not a measurement. The twins wave re-authored this file and

#: [assumed: this twin's inference cost is unmeasured on this branch;
#: commit=1e264c186c531e69acde5ad03ff6a79210626df4].
#: PRICED 2026-08-25 by the corpus pricing pass: tools/twin_coverage.py --measure min-of-3 on p14-integration at the store-wave merge, pinned exactly under the suite's two-sided +-4 deterministic allowance.

#: through the same call-site typed dispatch the engine's own

#: RE-PINNED 2026-08-25, 43174 to 43185, on the QLF-boot final
#: tree: the engine now boots through engine/qlf_boot.pl, and any

#: the typed-dispatch question moved engine-side
#: (metta_typed_dispatch_applies/2, one extra frame per direct
